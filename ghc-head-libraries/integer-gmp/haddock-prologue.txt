This package provides the low-level implementation of the standard
'Integer' type based on the
<http://gmplib.org/ GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)>.

This package provides access to the internal representation of
'Integer' as well as primitive operations with no proper error
handling, and should only be used directly with the utmost care.
